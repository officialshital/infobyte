                <p>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar popularly known as Babasaheb, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and social reformer who inspired the Modern Buddhist Movement and campaigned against social discrimination against Untouchables (Dalits),
                    while also supporting the rights of women and labour. He was Independent India's first law minister and the principal architect of the Constitution of India.<br/><br></p>
                <p>Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning a law degree and various doctorates from Columbia University and the London School of Economics, and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science. In
                    his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals advocating political
                    rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India.</p>
                <p>In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar.<br/><br></p>
                <strong><u>Early life</u></strong> Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal,
                an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of
                Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was
                an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits,
                and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.<br/><br></p>
                <strong><u>career</u></strong> Post-secondary education In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old
                girl, Ramabai. The match per the customs prevailing at that time was arranged by the couple's parents.<br/></br>

                <strong>Studies at the University of Bombay</strong> In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him,
                the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an
                occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar,
                the author and a family friend. By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and
                started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.<br/><br/> Ambedkar at Columbia University, c.1916 Studies at Columbia University In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded
                a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia University
                in New York City. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology,
                History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy. In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Dividend of India – A Historic
                and Analytical Study, for a second M.A. On 9 May, he presented the paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree
                in economics at Columbia in 1927.<br/><br/> Ambedkar (In center line, first from right) with his professors and friends from the London School of Economics (1916–17) Studies at the London School of Economics In October 1916, he enrolled
                for the Bar course at Gray's Inn, and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection
                was dispatched on a different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity,
                and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which was awarded from University of London, and the same year he was called
                to the Bar by Gray's Inn<br/><br/>
